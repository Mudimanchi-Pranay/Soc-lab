# 🧠 SOC Investigation Methodology

The investigations in this project follow a repeatable analyst methodology.

### 1. Identify

Determine what triggered the security alert.

### 2. Triage

Assess the alert severity, context, and potential impact.

### 3. Validate

Determine whether the alert represents expected behavior, suspicious activity, or a potential security incident.

### 4. Investigate

Analyze endpoint, authentication, DNS, network, process, and system activity.

### 5. Correlate

Connect multiple events and indicators to establish an investigation timeline.

### 6. Hunt

Search available telemetry for related or previously unseen suspicious activity.

### 7. Map

Map observed behavior to relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques when supported by investigation evidence.

### 8. Respond

Determine appropriate containment, remediation, or escalation actions.

### 9. Document

Record evidence, findings, IOCs, impact, response actions, and final disposition.

---

# 🗺️ MITRE ATT&CK

MITRE ATT&CK is used to provide context to observed attacker behavior.

Investigation areas may include:

- Initial Access
- Execution
- Persistence
- Privilege Escalation
- Defense Evasion
- Credential Access
- Discovery
- Command and Control

### Example Investigation Mapping

```text
Security Event
      ↓
Identify Behavior
      ↓
Understand Attack Technique
      ↓
Map to MITRE ATT&CK
      ↓
Record Technique
      ↓
Use Mapping to Support Investigation
```

Techniques are mapped only when supported by the available investigation evidence.

# 🔍 Investigation Documentation

The repository separates detection content from investigation content so that each security scenario can be approached from both a detection and analyst-investigation perspective.

| Category | Location |
|---|---|
| Detection Rules | [`detections/`](./detections/) |
| Investigations | [`investigations/`](./investigations/) |
| IOC Resources | [`iocs/`](./iocs/) |
| Evidence | [`evidence/`](./evidence/) |
| Documentation | [`docs/`](./docs/) |
| Visual References | [`screenshots/`](./screenshots/) |

### Investigation Categories

- Brute Force
- Malware
- Phishing
- Port Scanning
- Suspicious DNS
- Suspicious PowerShell

Each investigation is structured around identifying suspicious activity, analyzing available evidence, extracting indicators, correlating events, assessing potential impact, and documenting the findings.

# 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was created as a practical cybersecurity portfolio project to demonstrate the ability to approach security events from a SOC Analyst perspective rather than only learning cybersecurity concepts theoretically.

The project emphasizes the complete investigation lifecycle:

Triage
  ↓
Validate
  ↓
Investigate
  ↓
Correlate
  ↓
Hunt
  ↓
Respond
  ↓
Document
```

The goal is to demonstrate practical understanding of how security alerts can be investigated, analyzed, correlated, and documented in a SOC environment.

# ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is intended for educational and defensive security purposes within a controlled laboratory environment.

All testing, attack simulation, and investigation activities should be performed only on systems and networks where appropriate authorization has been obtained.
